LibNoise For Java: Colonel Thirty Two's Modifications

Some cleanups to the libnoiseforjava project, including:

- VectorTable no longer allocated every sample
- ExceptionInvalidParam now extends IllegalArgumentException
- ExceptionNoModule now extends IllegalStateException
- ModuleBase is now abstract
- Converted to javadoc format somewhat (It's not great but it works)
